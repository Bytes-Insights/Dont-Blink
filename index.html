        <p>Something is not right.</p>

        <p>You remember being tired. Very tired, actually. You were told to keep an eye on the experiment at all times, no matter what. <span class="dialogue">Don't blink! Don't even blink!</span>, joked the chief-scientist. To which he promptly added, seeing your surprised and slightly alarmed face, <span class="dialogue">Just kidding, kid, don't be afraid. But, yeah, keep your eyes open, ok? I'll be back as soon as the system notifies me that the experiment is over.</span></p>

        <p><em>Don't blink</em>. For some reason, those words kept reverberating in your head. Haunting you.</p>

        <p>Anyway, there wasn't much you could do. The experiment was taking so long, there was nobody around, and the monotony seemed almost like a fog, getting more substantial by the minute. Then it happened: exhaustion made its final assault, and you napped. It wasn't much. But you shouldn't have. You know you shouldn't have.</p>

        <p>You woke up in alarm. You looked around. Nothing seemed to have changed, at first. But there was this uncanny feeling, this... stillness. Time seemed to have stopped, somehow. And then you looked at the terminal screen:</p>

        <p><span class="terminal">Speak passphrase to terminate experiment</span></p>

        <p>Nobody said anything about passphrase. And shouldn't the experiment terminate itself?</p>

        <p>Something is definitely not right.</p>
        
        <p>You decide to go out and look for answers.</p>

        <p>Only then you notice, and that sends chills down your spine:</p>

        <p>The doors are gone.</p>
            
        <p>There is no way out, except for the main entrance, straight ahead. But instead of the usual sleek metal doors, there is only a dark, long corridor. You wonder why the lights are behaving weirdly. You hear some creepy voice far away. What is it saying? Something about being afraid?</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">Well, let's do this</span>, you tell yourself.</p> 
        
        <p>Strangely, you feel that there was a reply inside your head...</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">Don't blink</span>.</p>

        <h2>The Game</h2>

        <p><strong>Don't Blink!</strong> is an innovative first-person horror game with an unusual controller, besides the traditional joystick: your own eyes! Players will immerse themselves in an eerie, maze-like environment, pursued by creepy creatures that get closer every time the player blinks (detected by the webcam). The only way out of this terrorizing place is to find the correct passphrase and say it aloud to a computer terminal. But to do that, the player will first need to solve three creative puzzles, one for each word of the passphrase!</p>

        <p>Check out the demo below! Read on to learn more about this project.</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <h3>Goals and Motivation</h3>

        <p>This project was developed for the 2023 edition of the "Advanced Graphics and Interaction" course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.</p>

        <p>The project's main goal was to learn and experiment with cutting-edge graphics and interaction technology. Other goals included learning about crafting an interactive horror experience and, for that objective, setting the desired atmosphere using shaders and creating immersion in a horror environment using soundscapes and 3D sounds.</p>

        <h3>Graphics and Interaction</h3>

        <p>One of the early decisions in the development of the project was to use an innovative and advacend form of interaction outside the realm of XR (Extended Reality). Our team had just developed a previous project that used AR (Augmented Reality), and our classmates had developed many interesting experiences using AR and VR (Virtual Reality). For that reason, we felt compelled to explore other possibilities for advanced interaction beyond XR. And one of the possibilities that piqued our curiosity was the use of Computer Vision techniques to detect the player's face, its movements and blinks. That seemed to offer the right combination of technical challenge, learning potential, innovative and creative gameplay possibilites, quirkness and fun.</p>

        <p>One major and early inspiration for the project was the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_Angel">Weeping Angels</a> from the famous science-fiction series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a>:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_Angel">
            <p>When they are not being observed by another being, Weeping Angels can move very quickly and silently. Their phenomenal speed allows them to close distances of metres literally in the blink of an eye. However, when they are being observed they become "quantum-locked", occupying a single position in space and becoming stone. In this state, they are frozen and difficult to destroy.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>As for the visuals, from the outset we decided that we wanted to explore the aesthetics and concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)">liminal spaces</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">The Backrooms</a>, to create an eerie environment for the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we discussed the early concepts and ideas in supervision sessions with the teaching staff, many suggestions came up. We ended up embracing the idea of designing our &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; according to to the concept of <strong>biblically accurate angels</strong>:

            <figure>

            </figure>
        </p>

        <p>Another idea that came up in the supervision sessions that we adopted was to apply old CRTs and VCRs effects in our visuals. Those were implemented with shaders and post-processing effects for our chosen game develeopment platform, Unity.</p>
