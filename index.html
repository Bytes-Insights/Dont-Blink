        <p>Something is not right.</p>

        <p>You remember being tired. Very tired, actually. You were told to keep an eye on the experiment at all times, no matter what. <span class="dialogue"> Don't even blink!</span>, joked the chief-scientist. To which he promptly added, seeing your surprised and slightly alarmed face, <span class="dialogue">Just kidding, kid, don't be afraid. But, yeah, keep your eyes open, ok?</span></p>

        <p><em>Don't blink</em>. For some reason, those words keep reverberating in your head. Haunting you.</p>

        <p>Anyway, there wasn't much you could do. The experiment was taking so long, there was nobody around, the monotony seemed like a fog, getting somehow more substantial by the minute. Then it happened: exhaustion made its final assault, and you napped. It wasn't much. But you shouldn't. You know you shouldn't.</p>

        <p>You woke up in alarm. You looked around. Nothing seemed to have changed, at first. But there was this uncanny feeling, this... stillness. Time seemed to have stopped, somehow. And then you looked at the terminal screen, and that frozen screen was what sent chills down your spine:</p>

        <p><span class="terminal">Speak passphrase to terminate experiment</span></p>

        <p>Nobody said anything about passphrase. And shouldn't the experiment terminate itself?</p>

        <p>Something is definitely not right. You decide to go out and look for answers. You wonder why the lights are behaving weirdly. You hear some creepy voice. What is it saying? Something about being afraid?</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">Well, let's do this</span>, you tell yourself.</p> 
        
        <p>Strangely, you feel that there was a reply inside your head...</p>
